I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my supervisor, Doctor Belaqziz Salwa, she convincingly guided and encouraged me to be professional and do the right thing even when the road got tough. Without her persistent help, the goal of this project would not have been realized.\\
I wish to acknowledge the help provided by the administration staff in Ibn Zohr University \ac{FSA}, Faculty of Science, and would like to thank them for giving us a great studying environment. And to all our classmates and the professors of Computer Science Departement for having contributed in the formulation of our ideas and for providing a suitable working environment towards the completion of this project.\\
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents for raising me, and to my friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and developing this project. \\
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.

Crowdfunding refers to behavior where public individuals, rather than institutions, to use digital
technologies to make financial contributions to people, projects, or businesses in response to
either financial or developmental commitments from those people, projects, or businesses.
Sahem Crowdfunding Platform is a project that aims to develop a system that will be a gateway to allow project funders to
contribute towards a good project idea of a creator who lacks sufficient resources to implement
the project idea. It is important to develop this project because it will seek to create a platform
that will bridge the gap between viable project ideas and successful implementation of these
projects so that good project ideas that can benefit individuals and the community at large cannot
go into a waste.
With the aim to successfully develop this project, we will employ the use of the Software
development methodology, Iterations and Increments process, as well as we will be using the Kanban board Model
to divide and organize our project into small tasks, and also will be carrying out reviews and analysis of existing solutions in an attempt to
create a unique user experience with the use of Stripe API as payment.
