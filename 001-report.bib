  abstract={Existing research on antecedent of funding success mainly focuses on basic project properties such as funding goal, duration, and project category. In this study, we view the process by which project owners raise funds from backers as a persuasion process through project descriptions. Guided by the unimodel theory of persuasion, this study identifies three exemplary antecedents (length, readability, and tone) from the content of project descriptions and two antecedents (past experience and past expertise) from the trustworthy cue of project descriptions. We then investigate their impacts on funding success. Using data collected from Kickstarter, a popular crowdfunding platform, we find that these antecedents are significantly associated with funding success. Empirical results show that the proposed model that incorporated these antecedents can achieve an accuracy of 73 {\%} (70 {\%} in F-measure). The result represents an improvement of roughly 14 percentage points over the baseline model based on informed guessing and 4 percentage points improvement over the mainstream model based on basic project properties (or 44 {\%} improvement of mainstream's performance over informed guessing). The proposed model also has superior true positive and true negative rates. We also investigate the timeliness of project data and find that old project data is gradually becoming less relevant and losing predictive power to newly created projects. Overall, this study provides evidence that antecedents identified from project descriptions have incremental predictive power and can help project owners evaluate and improve the likelihood of funding success.},

  abstract = {Perhaps the most striking feature of  "crowdfunding" is the broad geographic dispersion of investors in small, early-stage projects.  This contrasts with existing theories that predict entrepreneurs and investors will be co-located due to distance-sensitive costs. We examine a crowdfunding setting that connects artist-entrepreneurs with investors over the internet for financing musical projects. The average distance between artists and investors is about 3,000 miles, suggesting a reduced role for spatial proximity. Still, distance does play a role.  Within a single round of financing, local investors invest relatively early, and they appear less responsive to decisions by other investors. We show this geography effect is driven by investors who likely have a personal connection with the artist-entrepreneur ("family and friends"). Although the online platform seems to eliminate most distance-related economic frictions such as monitoring progress, providing input, and gathering information, it does not eliminate social-related frictions.},

  abstract = { While current research treats the crowdfunders as a homogeneous group, we argue that such an assumption may limit our understanding of the complexities of the crowdfunder community. In this paper, we take a first step by identifying different archetypes of crowdfunders. Using public data from Kickstarter, we identified four distinct types of crowdfunders: Active Backers, Trend Followers, the Altruistic, and the Crowd. Our results show that crowdfunders are highly heterogeneous, with different motivations that are reflected in their strategies and behaviors. We further hypothesized and tested how the strategies and motivations of different crowdfunder archetypes further influence their choices of when and which projects to fund. In so doing, we not only reconcile conflicting results from the literature, but also synthesize differing theoretical perspectives that have been applied to understand the crowdfunding phenomenon. }
